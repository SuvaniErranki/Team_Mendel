# Hack Bio Internship

## Team Mendel

HackBio is a 5-weeks virtual research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping scientists globally with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills.
We are a team of 10 people from different parts of the world met here for the internship.

I am a biotechnology graduate currently pursuing a doctoral degree in Wildlife Science at Wildlife Institute of India, India. My current research includes developing a baseline for genetic monitoring of these species and formulating scientific-based conservation measures to aid in the recovery of these populations in India based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellite loci. I am interested in understanding these species evolutionary aspects through genomics.
